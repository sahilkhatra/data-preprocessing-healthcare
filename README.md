Stroke Prediction Analysis - Jupyter Notebook Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project that performs an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing information about patients and their likelihood of having a stroke. The project includes various data visualization techniques and data preprocessing steps to gain insights and prepare the dataset for further analysis or predictive modeling.

Project Overview

The analysis in the Jupyter Notebook follows these steps:

-Generate descriptive statistics for the dataset, including handling missing values in the BMI column.
-Visualize stroke frequency across different parameters using bar plots.
-Analyze the impact of age on stroke occurrence with distribution plots and provide a summary of the findings.
-Investigate the likelihood of patients getting a stroke using violin plots.
-Determine if the dataset is imbalanced, and provide a brief explanation.
-Create a heatmap to visualize correlations among variables and describe the results, highlighting the strongest correlations.
-Identify and remove outliers in the BMI and Average_Glucose columns.
-Handle missing values in the BMI column using an appropriate imputation method.
-Transform variables of object datatype using the Label Encoder library.
-This project demonstrates various data analysis and preprocessing techniques, providing valuable insights into the factors that may contribute to stroke occurrence and preparing the dataset for further exploration, such as building a predictive model.
